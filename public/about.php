    <h3>Our Journey</h3>
    <p>
        Founded in February 2024 in The Hague, Netherlands, our journey to build this bot took ten months. From the start, we knew that working with AI would be challenging due to its relatively new and complex nature. However, we were inspired by the incredible potential AI offers to improve people's lives. This shared vision brought Hidde and Neo together. Although we attended the same high school, we had never spoken until we joined forces for this project. Our cooperation operates under the name <strong>DTI</strong>, which stands for <strong>Davids, Troenopawiro Intelligence</strong>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The past ten months have gone by quickly and have taught us a great deal about AI. Several times a week, we worked on the bot in the evenings after school or work. Today, we have created a bot designed to support people in their online shopping journeys. The bot provides you with quick insights into webshops and their assortments and, most importantly, saves customers time by guiding them effectively to the products that best match their needs and preferences.
    </p>
